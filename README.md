# ChatGPT Clone

A simple ChatGPT clone application built using Node.js and React. This project simulates a chat interface where users can interact with a model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, allowing them to ask questions, open old chats, and create new conversations.

## Features

- **Ask Any Question**: Users can ask questions and receive responses generated by the ChatGPT model.
- **Open Old Chats**: Users can view and continue previous chat conversations.
- **Create New Chats**: Users can start new conversations and chat with the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server for handling requests and managing chat data.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrated for generating responses to user queries.
